# React Color Palette Generator

A simple, interactive color palette generator built with React. This single-page application allows users to create, customize, and export beautiful color palettes without requiring any installation or backend.

## Features

- Generate color palettes with different themes:
  - Random colors
  - Harmonious colors (evenly spaced hues)
  - Monochromatic colors (same hue, different lightness)
- Customize the number of colors in your palette (2-10)
- Copy color codes to clipboard with a single click
- Export your palette as:
  - JSON format
  - CSS variables
- View and reload from a history of previously generated palettes
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No build process, installation, or server is required.

## How It Works

This application is built using:
- React (loaded via CDN)
- ReactDOM (loaded via CDN)
- Babel for JSX transformation (loaded via CDN)
- Pure JavaScript for color manipulation
- CSS for styling

All code is contained in a single HTML file, making it extremely portable and easy to use.
